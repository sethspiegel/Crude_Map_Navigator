# Crude_Map_Navigator
a basic ASCII-form navigation tool that accepts a text map and determines if you can travel from an origin to destination with given routes.

Accepts a map of locations and one-way connections between locations in the form 'CityA-CityB, CityA-CityE, CityB-CityA, CityE-CityB, etc.'
After inputting an origin and destination location, will determine if it is possible to traverse the map along the given routes to travel from the origin to the destination, and,   if yes, prints out the route taken.
